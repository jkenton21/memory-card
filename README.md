## Memory Card Game

This is a memory game where you have a certain number of states you have to choose from.

Then after you make a selection they choices get randomly scrambled up and you have to choose another one without picking one you have already picked before.

The game will increment your score until you pick one you have already picked before then it will end.

There are 10 options to choose from so the maximum score you can get is 10.
